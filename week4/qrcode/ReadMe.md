# 2.4 QR Code Project

Author: Bryceson Gaoiran
Date: 2026-02-03

Overview
- Prompts the user for a URL, generates a QR code image from that URL, and saves both the QR image (`qr_img.png`) and the original URL (`URL.txt`).

AI-generated parts
- All comments and the top-line note in `solution.js` were generated by AI. The code itself (logic and functions) was written/edited by a human developer and the assistant; only the comments/header note were generated by AI.

How to install
```bash
cd "QR code/2.4 QR Code Project"
npm install
```

How to run
- Non-interactive (CLI argument):
```bash
node solution.js "https://example.com"
```
This will immediately generate `qr_img.png` and `URL.txt` containing the provided URL.

- Interactive (prompt):
```bash
node solution.js
# then type a URL when prompted (include http:// or https://)
```

Basic tests & results
- Test 1 — CLI argument
  - Command: `node solution.js "https://example.com"`
  - Expected: `qr_img.png` and `URL.txt` are created; `URL.txt` contains the sample URL.
  - Result: PASS — files were created and `URL.txt` contains `https://example.com`.

- Test 2 — Interactive prompt
  - Command: `node solution.js` then enter `https://github.com/Bryceson-ai/ics385spring2026` at the prompt.
  - Expected: `qr_img.png` and `URL.txt` are created; `URL.txt` contains the entered URL.
  - Result: PASS — files were created; `URL.txt` contains the entered GitHub URL.

Notes & troubleshooting
- If PowerShell blocks `npm` due to execution policies, run `npm.cmd install` or open a different shell (Command Prompt) and run `npm install` there.
- Tested environment: Node.js (v25.x) on Windows; `inquirer` and `qr-image` are required dependencies (see `package.json`).

Files produced by tests
- `qr_img.png` — PNG image of the QR code (binary file).
- `URL.txt` — plain text file containing the URL used to generate the QR code.

If you want, I can:
- open the generated `qr_img.png` now, or
- add a small npm `script` to run sample tests automatically.

Skills learned
- Added CLI-arg support and simple URL validation.
- Refactored generation into a reusable function and saved outputs with `fs`.
